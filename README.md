# Adaptive Histogram Equalization

## Description

[Adaptive Histogram Equalization](https://towardsdatascience.com/histogram-equalization-5d1013626e64) is a contrast enhancing technique in Image Processing. Adaptive Histogram Equalization considers the global contrast of the image, whereas [Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization#:~:text=Ordinary%20AHE%20tends,excess%20is%20negligible.) considers the local contrast which preventes unnecessary contrast enhancement. Both these techniques are implemented in this project without the use of inbuilt functions.


## Data

* Input set of frames

## Approach

### Adaptive Histogram Equalization

* Convert frame to Grayscale and create a Frequcny matrix of size 256 where the element at each index is the number of pixels with the value of that index.

* Find the Cumulative Sum of this matrix and divide by the total number of pixels in the frame to get the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) matrix.

* Multiply each element in the CDF by 255 and fill these values in the corresponding pixels to get the Adaptive Histogram Equalized Image.


### Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)

* The entire frame is divided into a grid of 8x8 and the following process is carried out for all the 64 parts of the frame.

* Similar to the previous case, a frequency matrix is created.

* A limit of 40 pixel is set and all the pixels which have a intensity frequency greater than 40 are set to 40. 

* The total number of excess pixels for all intensities is saved and equally divided between all the intensities.

* With this new Frequency matrix, further steps same as the previous section are followed.

* All the 64 parts of the image are combined to form the CLAHE output frame.
